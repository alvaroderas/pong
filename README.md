# Pong
A recreation of the classic Pong game using OOP with Python and the Pygame library.


## Background
This is my first project I developed as a student interested in CS. It was designed and implemented in 2022, and I updated it with documentation in 2023. It was pretty fun to make, and although features like physics and collisions were challenging, I felt satisfied with the final product. The game made me want to pursue studying CS in the future!
